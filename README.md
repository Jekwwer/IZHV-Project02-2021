## Task: Unity Game Fix Exercise

[Full Assignment Description](http://cphoto.fit.vutbr.cz/ludo/courses/izhv/exercises/e2/)

**Exercise Objectives:**

1. **Acquaintance with Unity Editor:**

   - Explore and familiarize yourself with the Unity Editor layout and features.
   - To assist in understanding Unity basics, refer to these resources:
     - [Unity Learn](https://learn.unity.com/)
     - [Unity Manual](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html)

2. **Diagnose and Fix the Game Template:**

   - Launch the game using the Play button (triangle icon at the top). This will highlight various problems within the game. Here are some issues you may notice:
     - **Unclear Mechanics:** The game's controls are not intuitive. (Hint: Use 'Space' for jumping and 'W' and 'S' for swapping.)
     - **High Difficulty:** The jump doesn't surpass obstacles efficiently, and swapping feels challenging.
     - **Frustrating Gameplay:** The obstacles, or boxes, are too large, leading to unjust collisions.
     - **Repetitive Elements:** The spawning rate of the boxes is too consistent, lacking variety.
   - Your mission is to address these problems:
     - Experiment with the properties of the `Player` and `Spawner` GameObjects in the scene.
     - Adjust properties such as the gravity in the `Player`'s Rigidbody 2D or the jump parameters in the Player script.
     - Modify the spawn rate within the Spawner's script.
     - Optionally, if you're feeling bold, tweak the Spawner script to make boxes appear in diverse patterns.
     - Add textual instructions in the game to guide players on controls and objectives.

3. **Export and Integrate:**
   - Once you're satisfied with the gameplay, proceed to the following section to learn how to export the game and incorporate it into your web template.
